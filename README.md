# Manual_API_Testing

This project uses Postman for:

Manual API Testing: Validating endpoints by sending requests and inspecting responses.

Lightweight Automation: Leveraging built-in test scripts and code snippets for automated assertions within Postman.

Mock Server: Simulating API responses using Postmanâ€™s Mock Server to support frontend/backend development and testing.

Monitoring: Scheduling automated collection runs with Postman Monitors to track uptime, validate API behavior, and receive alerts on failures.
